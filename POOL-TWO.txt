    -can hit any of them on your turn as long as they are on the ~2/3 of the board closest to your side

    -sudden death if game takes too long - first to sink after sudden death hits wins 
-game loop

        -place several holes randomly, symmetrically about the origin
        -place trees/decoration, neutral balls in the middle third
    -building phase
        -you get a budget
        -taking turns placing offensive / defensive balls on the third of the board with your pockets on it
